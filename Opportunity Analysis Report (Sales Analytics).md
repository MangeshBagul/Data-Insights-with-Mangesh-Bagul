**Business Problem:**
Sales leadership needed real-time, accurate visibility of the sales pipeline value—across multiple regions, channels, and stages. Existing reporting was manual, error-prone, and prevented data-driven opportunity prioritization.

**Technical & Business Analysis:**

  Data modeling: Created a star schema in Power BI using Fact_Opportunities and dimension tables for regions, stages, reps, and channels.

  DAX measures: Developed formulas for win rate, pipeline value by stage, deal size, and cycle duration. Leveraged Time Intelligence for period-over-period analysis.

  Visualizations: Multi-page report with executive summary, funnel breakdown, win/loss by territory, and channel performance.

  Interactivity: Enabled filtering/drill-down to individual rep/channel/territory.
