# Data-Insights-with-Mangesh-Bagul
Welcome to my personal Power BI portfolio repository! Here you will find a collection of Power BI projects and dashboards that demonstrate my skills and expertise in data visualization, business intelligence, and analytics using Power BI.

**About Me**

I am a Analyst with 5+ years of deep experience in the US Mortgage domain. My background combines hands-on mortgage operations with the ability to convert raw loan data into meaningful dashboards, making me uniquely capable of supporting analytics needs that usually demand 8–10 years of experience.

I have worked extensively across key stages of the mortgage lifecycle, including Initial and Final CD preparation, CD balancing, TRID compliance review, title coordination, lender guideline checks, conditions validation, investor guideline compliance, and QC/post-closing due diligence.

Over the past few years, I have upskilled into Power BI and SQL through multiple end-to-end reporting projects. Today, I can independently build mortgage-specific dashboards such as CD accuracy reports, post-closing quality analytics, turn-time performance, exception tracking, and TRID compliance monitoring.

My strengths include data modeling, DAX measure creation, performance optimization, and storytelling through clean, business-friendly visuals. I bring a combination of process expertise + analytical skill, making me a strong fit for Power BI, Business Analyst, and reporting roles in the mortgage industry.
